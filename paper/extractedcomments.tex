%\section{An extension to characteristic-0}
%
%Now,
%let $R$ be a $\Z^r$-graded ring with $R_0 = k$ a subfield of $\C$, and let $M$ be a homogeneous $R$-module.
%%By an eigenvalue of an element $\a \in \End_R(M)$, we mean an eigenvalue of the linear operator $\a\otimes R/m: M/mM \to M/mM$ defined over some algebraic extension. (Thus, in particular every $\a \in \End_R(M)$ will have eigenvalues.)
%
%\begin{thm}
%  $M$ is indecomposable if and only if any element $\a \in \End_R(M)$ reduces to an endomorphism of $M/mM$ with only one eigenvalue.
%\end{thm}
%
%\begin{proof}
%\devlin{TODO: flesh this out a bit}
%  From Section~\ref{sec:main-alg} we know that if $M$ is decomposable then in fact a general endomorphism reduces modulo $m$ to a linear operator with distinct eigenvalues.
%  So we need only show that if $M$ is indecomposable then any endomorphism has exactly one eigenvalue.
%  Let $\a_0: M\to M$ have two eigenvalues $\l_1,\l_2$, and let $\a = \a_0 -\l_1\cdot \id_M$.
%
%  This remains true after reduction modulo an open set of primes $p$ (TODO: add proof; the idea is that taking determinants commutes with reduction modulo $p$).
%  For each prime $p$, let $\a_p: M_p\to M_p$ be the reduction modulo $p$ of $\a$; we know then from Section~\ref{sec:main-alg} that $M_p$ splits as $\im(\a_p^{d_p})\oplus N_p$ for some $N_p\neq 0$ and some $d_p = p^e(p^e-1)$. Moreover, by shrinking the set of primes $p$ we can guarantee that $\im(\a_p)  = \im(\a)_p\neq 0$.
%
%  In other words, we have a module $B$ and a submodule $A\subset B$ such that $A_p\subset B_p$ is a direct summand for an infinite set of primes $p$. We claim that this implies that $A\subset B$ is already a direct summand.
%  The inclusion $i:A\subset B$ splits if and only if
%  the induced map $i^\sharp: \Hom(B,A)\to \Hom(A,A)$ has $\id_A$ in its image.
%  This occurs if and only if the induced map
%  $$R\xra{\id_A} \Hom(A,A)\to \Hom(A,A)/\im i^\sharp$$ is the zero map.
%  However, we know that since $i_p: A_p\subset B_p$ splits that
%  $$
%  R_p \to \Hom(A_p,A_p) = \Hom(A,A)_p \to \Hom(A_p,A_p)/\im i_p^\sharp = (\Hom(A,A)/\im i^\sharp)_p
%  $$
%  is the zero map for an open dense set of $p$. Thus, the original map must have been zero as well.
%\end{proof}
